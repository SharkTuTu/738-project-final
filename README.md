# Project Title: Analysis of Passerine Cup Nest Size

This project involves the analysis of passerine cup nest sizes using a dataset of measurements from various species. The goal is to understand the factors influencing the outer volume of nests. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression to explore these relationships.

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a public repository. It contains measurements of outer nest volumes along with various environmental and geographical factors. The data file in the 738-project-final directory.
The script to run is in 738 project code. The relevant summary is in analysis.Rmd
The analysis involves data cleaning, performing PCA to identify key factors, and using linear regression to model the relationship between these factors and nest size.
